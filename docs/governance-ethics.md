# Governance, ethics & privacy

- Use public, licensed monitoring data; document licenses and usage terms.
- For health data, ensure de-identification and follow usage restrictions.
- Maintain data lineage: keep a minimal README per dataset snapshot.
- Report limitations: sensor gaps, method assumptions, AQI rounding rules.
- Align outputs with responsible AI principles and local regulations.
